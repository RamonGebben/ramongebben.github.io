            <h2><a href="/articles/shipit/">Shipit</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Shipit (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit">shipitjs/shipit</a>, License: <span class="caps">MIT</span>, npm:&nbsp;shipit)</p>
<p>Shipit is an automation engine and a deployment tool written for&nbsp;Node.</p>
<p>Shipit is an alternative for <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a>. If you are not familiar Capistrano, it is a remote server automation and deployment tool written in Ruby.
Since Capistrano was written in Ruby, you needed to be comfortable working in Ruby and be familiar with the tooling that comes with it.
Nowadays we are using Javascript for everything. Web servers, build tooling, bot’s you can even control a drone using Javascript.
So it makes sense to do deployment in Javascript as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Shipit’s task structure is very similar to that of <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. Since they are both based on <a href="https://github.com/orchestrator/orchestrator">orchestrator</a>.</p>
<p>Besides the main <span class="caps">API</span> for handling remote work, there is also a dedicated deploy package based on git and rsync commands.
With which you can deploy tag, branch or commit. Add additional behavior using hooks, build your project locally or remotely and you can do easy&nbsp;rollback.</p>
<p>A simple <code>shipitfile.js</code> would look something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="built_in">module</span>.exports = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params">shipit</span>) </span>{
  <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'shipit-deploy'</span>)(shipit);

  shipit.initConfig({
    <span class="keyword">default</span>: {
      workspace: <span class="string">'/tmp/github-monitor'</span>,
      deployTo: <span class="string">'/tmp/deploy_to'</span>,
      repositoryUrl: <span class="string">'https://github.com/user/repo.git'</span>,
      ignores: [<span class="string">'.git'</span>, <span class="string">'node_modules'</span>],
      rsync: [<span class="string">'--del'</span>],
      keepReleases: <span class="number">2</span>,
      key: <span class="string">'/path/to/key'</span>,
      shallowClone: <span class="literal">true</span>
    },
    staging: {
      servers: <span class="string">'user@myserver.com'</span>
    }
  });
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <span class="caps">CLI</span> structure works like: <code>shipit &lt;environment&gt; &lt;tasks ...&gt;</code>.
So with a <code>shipitfile.js</code> like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">shipit staging deploy
</code></pre>

          <section class="content"><p>Usually I only mention stuff that is on Github, but I came across a tool which makes my personal development process a lot better.
Sadly it’s not open source or at least not that I can tell. For now it’s still free, but eventually it will have a pricing. Do not think this is sponsored content, <strong>it is not</strong>.</p>
<p>So now you are probably curious what it’s all about. The tools is called <a href="https://getsiphon.com/">Siphon</a> and what it does is make you not use Xcode for developing and deployment of React Native&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p>The sandbox environment lets you create and test React Native apps without installing Xcode or Android Studio, which really amazed me.
This would mean that you do not need to be on an Apple system to develop for iOS and Android, but if you prefer working on <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> for instance, you can.
There is no Windows support <em>yet</em>. If you were wondering, but the team is working on&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Because the project is still in alpha it is missing support for a lot of things, such as the entire Android platform, but they will be rolling out plenty more features over coming&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>On the Siphon website are some wonderful tutorials on how to use their cli and sandbox. If I peaked your interest take a look at the <a href="https://getsiphon.com/docs/quickstart/">Getting Started</a>&nbsp;guide.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/inspire-tree/">Inspire Tree</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Inspire Tree (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/helion3/inspire-tree">helion3/inspire-tree</a>, License: <span class="caps">MIT</span>, npm:&nbsp;inspire-tree)</p>
<p>First of all I would like to thank everybody that took the time to look at the <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges">Weekly Challenges</a> over the weekend. If you have not looked at the challenge of last week you can still submit until Thursday&nbsp;night.</p>
<p>Now to business, <a href="https://github.com/viveleroi">Mike Botsko</a> sent in Inspire Tree which is a un-opinionated collapsable tree <span class="caps">UI</span> library.
The need for the library grew with the developers because the alternatives already out there where not extensive enough or just took to much hacking to make it listen to what they&nbsp;wanted.</p>
<p>Some of the features that jumped out to me&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Events&nbsp;everywhere</li>
<li>~40k minified,&nbsp;uncompressed</li>
<li>No external&nbsp;dependencies</li>
<li>Load data directly, via promises, callbacks,&nbsp;etc</li>
<li>Load child nodes upfront or dynamically (or a mix of&nbsp;both)</li>
<li>Tri-state checkboxes&nbsp;(optional)</li>
<li>Multiselect&nbsp;(optional)</li>
<li>Search by plain string, RegExp, custom matcher, or external resources&nbsp;(optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>The renderer used by the library can be replaced with a custom renderer for framework support.
Sadly there is only one example listed within the docs but it will be easy it would be to include it within React or Riot due to the Virtual&nbsp;<span class="caps">DOM</span>.</p>
<p>To work with this library you need to have an element on the page to&nbsp;target:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">div</span> <span class="attribute">class</span>=<span class="value">"myTree"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can init tree functionality and fetch the data at the same time like&nbsp;so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">const</span> tree = <span class="keyword">new</span> InspireTree({
    target: <span class="string">'.tree'</span>,
    data: $.getJSON(<span class="string">'http://example.com/some-data.json'</span>)
});
</code></pre>
<p>When custom behavior is needed you can attach this to be fired when curtain events are emitted. There is a list of events present on the Github page for reference. This is an example of how a click handler would look&nbsp;like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">tree.on(<span class="string">'node.click'</span>, (evt, node) =&gt; {
    <span class="comment">// node clicked!</span>
    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log([<span class="string">'node clicked'</span>, evt, node]);
});
</code></pre>
<p>The rest of the <span class="caps">API</span> is very well documented so I would suggest you browse through it if you need more convincing that this is one of the most extensive UI tree library out&nbsp;there.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Since I started missing a lot of Friday posts, I came up with a new section for which I can prepare during the&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>I’m introducing Weekly Challenges. Every Friday I will post an assignment related to programming. These challenges can be math problems, mathematical phenomenons or building something using a previously mentioned&nbsp;library.</p>
<p>These assignments are to challenges yourself. This is not a competition. I will do my best to design/pick challenges that will be interesting for developers of all skill levels.
But do not feel limited to the challenge description, if you can create something more complex than the challenge describes, do&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>If you have great idea’s for futures challenges please submit it via <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/8FaZJSBxjO">this Google Form</a>.</p>
<p>An overview of the challenges can be found at <a href="/challenges">/challenges</a>. This weeks challenge is the <a href="/challenges/pythagoras-tree/">Pythagoras Tree</a>.</p>
