            <h2><a href="/articles/nuclear-js/">NuclearJS</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>NuclearJS (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/optimizely/nuclear-js">optimizely/nuclear-js</a>, License: <span class="caps">MIT</span>, npm:&nbsp;nuclear-js)</p>
<p>NuclearJS is a reactive flux implementation build with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">ImmutableJS</a> data structures.
It has been developed by <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>, which is a company that provides A/B testing suite and more as a&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>NuclearJS was designed first for large scale production apps. For a much more lightweight Flux implementation that shares many of the same ideas and design principles, as check out <a href="https://github.com/vigetlabs/microcosm">Microcosm</a>.</p>
<p>As we have seen many Flux implementations already we have grown skeptical about new implementations.
So that bears the question: “How NuclearJS differs from other Flux&nbsp;implementations?”.</p>
<p>Well all app state is in a singular immutable map. In development you can see your entire application state at every point in time thanks to awesome debugging tools built into&nbsp;NuclearJS.</p>
<p>State is not spread out through stores, instead stores are a declarative way of describing some top-level domain of your app state. For each key in the app state map a store declares the initial state of that key and how that piece of the app state reacts over time to actions dispatched on the flux&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Stores are not reference-able nor have any getX methods on them. Instead NuclearJS uses a functional lens concept called getters. In fact, the use of getters obviates the need for any store to know about another store, eliminating the confusing store.waitsFor method found in other flux&nbsp;implementations.</p>
<p>NuclearJS is insanely efficient - change detection granularity is infinitesimal, you can even observe computed state where several pieces of the state map are combined together and run through a transform function. NuclearJS is smart enough to know when the value of any computed changes and only call its observer if and only if its value changed in a way that is orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional dirty checking. It does this by leveraging ImmutableJS data structure and using a state1 !== state2 reference comparison which runs in constant&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Automatic data observation / rendering – automatic re-rendering is built in for React in the form of a very lightweight mixin. It is also easily possible to build the same functionality for any <span class="caps">UI</span> framework such as VueJS, AngularJS and even&nbsp;Backbone.</p>
<p>NuclearJS is not a side-project, it’s used as the default Flux implementation that powers all of Optimizely. It is well tested and will continue to be maintained for the foreseeable future. Our current codebase has over dozens of stores, actions and getters, we even share our prescribed method of large scale code organization and testing&nbsp;strategies.</p>
<p>For examples I would refer you to <a href="https://optimizely.github.io/nuclear-js/">project homepage</a> because there you can find better explaintions than I can give it in my daily&nbsp;posts.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>First of all let me say Happy new year! The last couple of weeks I did not do any posted due to all the celebrations and illness.
Luckily the holiday season is over and we can get back to creating and learning to make beautiful applications.
Something some people might be interested in is the results of the latest challenge which was <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow">“Let it snow”</a>.</p>
<p>Well sadly I only received two submissions. Which let me to believe people did not feel challenged by this assignment. I will do my best to find something more interesting.
The results can be found on the results page of the challenge which would be <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow/results">Daily-Javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow/results</a></p>
<p>From tomorrow on Daily-Javascript will be getting daily updates again. Hope you guys keep on&nbsp;reading.</p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;coding.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>First of all let me say Merry Christmas! Last weeks challenge was a blast and I’d like to thanks everybody who submitted a solution.
To view the submitted solutions check the <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/pythagoras-tree/results">results section of the challenge</a>.</p>
<p>For this weeks challenge I wanted to something Christmas themed and came up with a lot of ideas, but since we can not spend the entire week working on the challenge I thought to go for something simple: Let it&nbsp;snow.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/shipit/">Shipit</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Shipit (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit">shipitjs/shipit</a>, License: <span class="caps">MIT</span>, npm:&nbsp;shipit)</p>
<p>Shipit is an automation engine and a deployment tool written for&nbsp;Node.</p>
<p>Shipit is an alternative for <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a>. If you are not familiar Capistrano, it is a remote server automation and deployment tool written in Ruby.
Since Capistrano was written in Ruby, you needed to be comfortable working in Ruby and be familiar with the tooling that comes with it.
Nowadays we are using Javascript for everything. Web servers, build tooling, bot’s you can even control a drone using Javascript.
So it makes sense to do deployment in Javascript as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Shipit’s task structure is very similar to that of <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. Since they are both based on <a href="https://github.com/orchestrator/orchestrator">orchestrator</a>.</p>
<p>Besides the main <span class="caps">API</span> for handling remote work, there is also a dedicated deploy package based on git and rsync commands.
With which you can deploy tag, branch or commit. Add additional behavior using hooks, build your project locally or remotely and you can do easy&nbsp;rollback.</p>
<p>A simple <code>shipitfile.js</code> would look something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="built_in">module</span>.exports = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params">shipit</span>) </span>{
  <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'shipit-deploy'</span>)(shipit);

  shipit.initConfig({
    <span class="keyword">default</span>: {
      workspace: <span class="string">'/tmp/github-monitor'</span>,
      deployTo: <span class="string">'/tmp/deploy_to'</span>,
      repositoryUrl: <span class="string">'https://github.com/user/repo.git'</span>,
      ignores: [<span class="string">'.git'</span>, <span class="string">'node_modules'</span>],
      rsync: [<span class="string">'--del'</span>],
      keepReleases: <span class="number">2</span>,
      key: <span class="string">'/path/to/key'</span>,
      shallowClone: <span class="literal">true</span>
    },
    staging: {
      servers: <span class="string">'user@myserver.com'</span>
    }
  });
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <span class="caps">CLI</span> structure works like: <code>shipit &lt;environment&gt; &lt;tasks ...&gt;</code>.
So with a <code>shipitfile.js</code> like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">shipit staging deploy
</code></pre>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Usually I only mention stuff that is on Github, but I came across a tool which makes my personal development process a lot better.
Sadly it’s not open source or at least not that I can tell. For now it’s still free, but eventually it will have a pricing. Do not think this is sponsored content, <strong>it is not</strong>.</p>
<p>So now you are probably curious what it’s all about. The tools is called <a href="https://getsiphon.com/">Siphon</a> and what it does is make you not use Xcode for developing and deployment of React Native&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p>The sandbox environment lets you create and test React Native apps without installing Xcode or Android Studio, which really amazed me.
This would mean that you do not need to be on an Apple system to develop for iOS and Android, but if you prefer working on <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> for instance, you can.
There is no Windows support <em>yet</em>. If you were wondering, but the team is working on&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Because the project is still in alpha it is missing support for a lot of things, such as the entire Android platform, but they will be rolling out plenty more features over coming&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>On the Siphon website are some wonderful tutorials on how to use their cli and sandbox. If I peaked your interest take a look at the <a href="https://getsiphon.com/docs/quickstart/">Getting Started</a>&nbsp;guide.</p>
