</p>
Catbee is an high level isomorphic framework inspired and based on best practices from <a href="https://github.com/catberry/catberry">Catberry</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab">Baobab</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral">Cerebral</a>.</p>
<p>Catbee is Catberry little brother. Unlike Catberry, Catbee use “Single State Tree” conception.
All state mutations run in signals, and powered by the <a href="https://github.com/markuplab/appstate">AppState</a>&nbsp;module.</p>
<p>All data focused in Baobab tree, instead of distributed flux stores. The tree contains the full application state, and it has 2 interfaces: modify <span class="caps">API</span> also known as “Signals”, and read API also known as&nbsp;“Watchers”.</p>
<p>Signal is the only way to modify state tree. It looks like middleware, but it is way more flexible and adopted for sync/async operations.
If you want to learn more about signals, checkout <a href="http://cerebraljs.com/">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/markuplab/appstate">this</a>.
The developers recommend running signal on each user action, when you need change application state, and also signal automatically run on every url&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>Signals use composition conception, and contains an array of independent functions. It’s very simple way to maintain big codebase. Here is an example of a&nbsp;Signal:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">let</span> signal = [
  setLoading, <span class="comment">// Sync function</span>
  [ <span class="comment">// Here we run parallel functions</span>
    getUser, { <span class="comment">// Async function with 2 outputs success and error</span>
      success: [setUser], <span class="comment">// Run if we call output.success in getUser</span>
      error: [setUserError] <span class="comment">// Run if we call output.error in getUser</span>
    },
    getNews, { <span class="comment">// It's function will run parallel with getUser, like Promise.all</span>
      loaded: [setNews],
      error: [setNewsError]
    }
  ],
  unsetLoading
];
</code></pre>
<p>Components can access data by <a href="https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab#specialized-getters">watchers</a>. There are two main reasons you should use watchers. You’ll need data context for template rendering, and you’ll also need state update events to rerender your component.
You do not need bind watchers manually, it’s inside of&nbsp;Catbee.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="comment">// Here we use simple Baobab.watch <span class="caps">API</span></span>
<span class="built_in">module</span>.exports = {
  news: [<span class="string">'news'</span>, <span class="string">'data'</span>],
  isVisible: [<span class="string">'news'</span>, <span class="string">'UIState'</span>, <span class="string">'isVisible'</span>]
};

<span class="comment">// You can also use Baobab.watch dynamicly</span>
<span class="built_in">module</span>.exports = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params">attributes</span>) </span>{
  <span class="comment">// Here attributes is &lt;cat-component id="unique" cat-id="1" watcher= "dynamic"&gt;&lt;/cat-component&gt;</span>
  <span class="keyword">var</span> id = attributes[<span class="string">'cat-id'</span>];

  <span class="keyword">return</span> {
    title: [<span class="string">'news'</span>, <span class="string">'data'</span>, { id: id }, <span class="string">'title'</span>]
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p>I really like this library because of my associations with Baobab. My first encounter with it was via the post <a href="http://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2015/02/06/plant-a-baobab-tree-in-your-flux-application.html">“Plant a Baobab tree in your flux application”</a> which was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/christianalfoni">Christian Alfoni</a>. It lead me to think differently about flux and redux, I recommend you read&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to challenge yourself this week. I prepared another weekly challenge which is: <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/mandelbrot/">“Implement the Mandelbrot set using Javascript”</a>.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Little Loader (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/walmartlabs/little-loader">walmartlabs/little-loader</a>, License: <span class="caps">MIT</span>, npm:&nbsp;little-loader)</p>
<p>Little Loader is a lightweight JavaScript loader which is advertised as “The Only Correct Script Loader Ever Made”.
It was developed by <a href="http://formidable.com">Formidable</a> for a project they did for&nbsp;Mallmart.</p>
<p>The need for this library grew from the lack of browser support for the which the team needed.
To give an example look at the overview made by the&nbsp;team.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*NUr1sQqkxQ8mdAcrWWLvjg.png" alt="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*NUr1sQqkxQ8mdAcrWWLvjg.png"></p>
<p>I’m already using it in one of my projects because after watching the introduction video I was convinced this is the best library for dynamically loading remote JavaScript&nbsp;files.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F080X3Tp6_8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>So how do we work with it?
First of all make use it is installed by&nbsp;running:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npm i little-loader -S
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can require it within our app like&nbsp;so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">const</span> load = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">"little-loader"</span>);

load(<span class="string">"http://example.com/foo.js"</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params">err</span>) </span>{
  <span class="comment">// .. This is where you continue with your app.</span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>That’s all actually. There are multiple ways to include Little Loader. You can get it from a <span class="caps">CDN</span>, from npm and it is compatible with AMD loaders such as&nbsp;RequireJS.</p>
<p>When including Little Loader via a normal script tag, it will attach it self to the <code>window</code> Object and can be accessed via <code>window._lload</code> like&nbsp;so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript">
  <span class="built_in">window</span>._lload(<span class="string">"http://example.com/foo.js"</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params">err</span>) </span>{
    <span class="comment">// .. Your code....</span>
  });
</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

          <section class="content"><p>It’s Friday again, which means no new library today, but to make up for it I think I chose a really nice challenge. The Mandelbrot set.
Some of you guys are probably familiar with it already from school or as a performance&nbsp;test.</p>
<p>I came across this problem just recently when I was looking at the <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/articles/bigfloat/">bigfloat</a> library.
The developer included it as a performance demo and it got my interest because of <a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/performance.php?test=mandelbrot">“The Computer Language Benchmarks Game”</a>. Where it is listed as one of the benchmarks&nbsp;challenges.</p>
<p>For details on the challenge go to the <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/mandelbrot">challenge page</a>.</p>
<p>The results will be up next Friday so make sure you have submitted your implementation before&nbsp;then.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/nuclear-js/">NuclearJS</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>NuclearJS (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/optimizely/nuclear-js">optimizely/nuclear-js</a>, License: <span class="caps">MIT</span>, npm:&nbsp;nuclear-js)</p>
<p>NuclearJS is a reactive flux implementation build with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">ImmutableJS</a> data structures.
It has been developed by <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>, which is a company that provides A/B testing suite and more as a&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>NuclearJS was designed first for large scale production apps. For a much more lightweight Flux implementation that shares many of the same ideas and design principles, as check out <a href="https://github.com/vigetlabs/microcosm">Microcosm</a>.</p>
<p>As we have seen many Flux implementations already we have grown skeptical about new implementations.
So that bears the question: “How NuclearJS differs from other Flux&nbsp;implementations?”.</p>
<p>Well all app state is in a singular immutable map. In development you can see your entire application state at every point in time thanks to awesome debugging tools built into&nbsp;NuclearJS.</p>
<p>State is not spread out through stores, instead stores are a declarative way of describing some top-level domain of your app state. For each key in the app state map a store declares the initial state of that key and how that piece of the app state reacts over time to actions dispatched on the flux&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Stores are not reference-able nor have any getX methods on them. Instead NuclearJS uses a functional lens concept called getters. In fact, the use of getters obviates the need for any store to know about another store, eliminating the confusing store.waitsFor method found in other flux&nbsp;implementations.</p>
<p>NuclearJS is insanely efficient - change detection granularity is infinitesimal, you can even observe computed state where several pieces of the state map are combined together and run through a transform function. NuclearJS is smart enough to know when the value of any computed changes and only call its observer if and only if its value changed in a way that is orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional dirty checking. It does this by leveraging ImmutableJS data structure and using a state1 !== state2 reference comparison which runs in constant&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Automatic data observation / rendering – automatic re-rendering is built in for React in the form of a very lightweight mixin. It is also easily possible to build the same functionality for any <span class="caps">UI</span> framework such as VueJS, AngularJS and even&nbsp;Backbone.</p>
<p>NuclearJS is not a side-project, it’s used as the default Flux implementation that powers all of Optimizely. It is well tested and will continue to be maintained for the foreseeable future. Our current codebase has over dozens of stores, actions and getters, we even share our prescribed method of large scale code organization and testing&nbsp;strategies.</p>
<p>For examples I would refer you to <a href="https://optimizely.github.io/nuclear-js/">project homepage</a> because there you can find better explaintions than I can give it in my daily&nbsp;posts.</p>

Luckily the holiday season is over and we can get back to creating and learning to make beautiful applications.
Something some people might be interested in is the results of the latest challenge which was <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow">“Let it snow”</a>.</p>
<p>Well sadly I only received two submissions. Which let me to believe people did not feel challenged by this assignment. I will do my best to find something more interesting.
The results can be found on the results page of the challenge which would be <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow/results">Daily-Javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow/results</a></p>
<p>From tomorrow on Daily-Javascript will be getting daily updates again. Hope you guys keep on&nbsp;reading.</p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;coding.</p>
