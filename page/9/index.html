          <section class="content"><p>As first point of today here are <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/tic-tac-toe/results">last weeks results</a>.
Sadly still not a lot of submissions. The submissions I did receive are amazing great work guys.
I am curious about the reason behind the low number of submissions, is this because the challenges are to hard?
Or because they are not challenging enough? Maybe you guys don’t like the topics. I do not know.
Please tell me if you have any ideas on how I can get you guys to work on challenging problems and you will have&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>For this weeks challenge I had a fun idea, but sadly I did not find the time this week to prepare it.
So that will have to wait for some other week. This week we are gonna think about how to transfer&nbsp;knowledge.</p>
<p>Pick a topic which you feel comfortable with or something you find interesting and create a workshop for that topic.
You will be using the <a href="https://github.com/workshopper/workshopper">Workshopper</a> framework which I mentioned <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/articles/workshopper/">this week</a>.
For more detail on the challenge go to the <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/workshopper">challenge page</a>.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Mantra (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/kadirahq/mantra">kadirahq/mantra</a>, License:&nbsp;<span class="caps">MIT</span>)</p>
<p>Mantra is an application architecture for <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>.
If you are not familair with Meteor I would strongly advice you take a look at it.
The developers of Mantra try to achieve two main goals: High Maintainability and Future&nbsp;Proof.</p>
<p>Maintainability is a key factor for success when working within large teams.
Mantra achieves this by unit testing every part of the app, while following standards for <strong>everything</strong>. This makes it easy to add new users and work with&nbsp;teams.</p>
<p>There is a very extensive spec of how a Mantra application would work which can be found <a href="https://kadirahq.github.io/mantra/">here</a>.
I really like this approach, ‘cause it combines the best parts of all the new and shiny stuff out&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Today is the last day you can submit your solution for the <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/tic-tac-toe/">weekly challenge</a>. Next weeks challenge will be up tomorrow so make sure you check back then to see what I have in store for you&nbsp;next.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Workshopper (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/workshopper/workshopper">workshopper/workshopper</a>, License: <span class="caps">MIT</span>, npm:&nbsp;workshopper)</p>
<p>Workshopper is a terminal workshop runner framework. It gives you the tools to create workshops and exercises which can be run from any terminal.
Which is a great thing if you are teaching people how are still scared of the terminal. This way they will practice their programming skills and develop a sense of comfort on the command&nbsp;line.</p>
<p>Workshopper is being used by code schools like “<a href="https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode">Learn You Node</a>“ and <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">Nodeschool.io</a>. I came across a Hapi.js exercise as well, which made me think why not have an interactive introduction to your&nbsp;framework.</p>
<p>The framework is essentially a test-runner with a very fancy terminal <span class="caps">UI</span>.
The <code>workshopper</code> package is largely concerned with the menu system and some basic command-line parsing but much of the work for executing the exercise validation is handled by <a href="http://github.com/rvagg/workshopper-exercise">workshopper-exercise</a>.</p>
<p>I really like this project because it’s a nice and quick way to really get into how something works. For instance <a href="https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop">this workshop on functional Javascript</a>.</p>
<p>If you did not submit you solution to this weeks challenge, creating Tic Tac Toe, I’d advice you to get a move on it because there is only day remaining. If you need to refresh you memory on the challenge head over to <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/tic-tac-toe/">the challenge page</a>.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Nodal (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/keithwhor/nodal">keithwhor/nodal</a>, License: <span class="caps">MIT</span>, npm:&nbsp;nodal)</p>
<p>Nodal is a web server and <span class="caps">API</span> framework for Node.js. It is built upon an ideology of a robust, scalable microservice architecture.
It borrows a lot from <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> so working with the framework made me feel right at home since I used to do a lot of Rails.
With familiar commands such as: <code>nodal db:migrate</code>, <code>nodal g:controller</code> et&nbsp;cetra.</p>
<p>One of the features that really blew me away was how a scaffold <span class="caps">CRUD</span> handles query parameters.
It uses the <code>.where(this.params.query)</code> where the query params will be applied as a filter.
Which uses a very similar syntax as the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/db/queries/#retrieving-specific-objects-with-filters">filter methods in Django’s <span class="caps">ORM</span></a>.</p>
<p>The framework is configured to use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgresql</a> as a database, which is a great idea in my opinion.
Especially since the framework tries to aim at developer who want a little more guidance in their development process to get familiar with Node.js and the Javascript eco system in&nbsp;general.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://youtu.be/IxBXkFbUqtk">posted a screencast</a> of him setting up a very simple twitter clone which I recommend you&nbsp;watch.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxBXkFbUqtk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>And there will be more screencast’s in the future. This will definitely be part of the next <span class="caps">API</span> I’m gonna&nbsp;build.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to challenge your self this week. There is still a challenge running which is <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/tic-tac-toe/">Make Tic Tac Toe in Javascript</a> but make sure you submit it before Friday is you want it to be shown in the weekly&nbsp;results.</p>

<p>First of all here is a link to <a href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/mandelbrot/results">last weeks results</a> sadly the challenge was a bit to hard, so I heard in some direct feedback. So I will switch it up this week.
No more fractals this time. This weeks challenge is create a Tic Tac Toe game using&nbsp;Javascript.</p>
<p>You can go two ways for this&nbsp;implementation.</p>
<p>The first one would be very naive. Simply switch between 2 users, the first user would be X the other would be O.
The program should be able to detect when one of the players has won or if it is a&nbsp;tie.</p>
<p>If you are feeling very confident implement <span class="caps">AI</span> for player O. Same rules would apply.
Be mindful in your implementation because next week there will come some additional&nbsp;requirements.</p>
<p>Again I’ve created <a href="http://codepen.io/DailyJavascript/pen/ZQXBaK">a Codepen for you to start with</a>.
Please submit your solution to this <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/vM1b4oUXC6">Google Form</a> and happy&nbsp;coding.</p>
