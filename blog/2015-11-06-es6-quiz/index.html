                                <p>Today I will not be checking any new library. It is time to invest in some more in depth knowledge of how ES6/ES2015/ESnext works. This week I was checking my reddit feed looking for something awesome to show you all, when I stumbled across <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/javascript-quiz-es6/?utm_source=javascriptweekly&amp;utm_medium=email">this quiz</a> from Perfect Skills.</p>
                                <p>I shared this quiz at my job and noticed that a lot of people were &quot;familiar&quot; with ES6. However nobody got a perfect score, Ok, the quiz is actually really hard, but still as frontend/javascript developer we should know the language we are working with or going to work with in the very near future. That is the reason why I would recommend everybody taking this quiz, because it will enlighten you on how much you do not know or fully understand about the new standard in Javascript.</p>
                                <p>The answers and explanation can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/DmitrySoshnikov/3928607cb8fdba42e712">here</a>, but I recommend that you do not look at them before taking the test.</p>
                                <p>I will be redoing this website over the weekend so I might not be able to provide you with a new post on Monday. The reason why I need to redo it, is because the static site generator I&#39;m using to supply you with new posts each day broke on me this week. I spend several hours debugging without any luck so I will be switching to <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">Wintersmith</a> with which I only had good experiences so hopefully I do not need to redo it any time soon. I will also be looking into including a comment section so I can here more back from you guys.</p>
                                <p>Thanks for all your loyal support and have a nice weekend. </p>
